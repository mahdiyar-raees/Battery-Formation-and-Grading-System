# Project overview
In this project, a battery formation device with 512 channels was designed and implemented. The device is capable of charging and discharging 18650 lithium batteries according to a given process. The purpose of the project is to optimize the performance and lifespan of lithium batteries by subjecting them to a controlled formation process. The device allows for precise control of the charging and discharging parameters of the batteries, which is essential for achieving consistent and reliable results. The project involved the design and fabrication of the device, as well as the development of the software and control system. The results of the project demonstrate the effectiveness of the battery formation process in improving the performance and reliability of lithium batteries.
